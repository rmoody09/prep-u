    <h2 class='sat-guide-section-header'>Remember That The Questions Are Ordered By Difficulty</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Be mindful of where you are in the module, and how difficult the question is likely to be. If you're on the first 5 questions, and something seems very tricky, you're probably overthinking it, and there is probably a relatively simple solution. If you are on the last 5 questions (especially if you're on the difficult second module), and the question seems pretty simple, then you're probably missing something and oversimplifying it. Of course, just because a question is "difficult" doesn't mean it will take a long time to solve - it just means that not many people will get it right. It's ok if you got the answer quickly, but if so it should probably be because you employed some technique or shortcut that most students aren't likely to be familiar with.
