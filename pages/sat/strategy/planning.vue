    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How should I prepare?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        <p>Your preparation strategy should be tailored to your learning style and areas that need improvement. Here are key considerations:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>CollegeBoard offers free official practice tests and questions that are most representative of the actual SAT</li>
            <li>Focus on mastering the core concepts tested in the SAT</li>
            <li>While CollegeBoard provides excellent practice materials, they don't focus on test-taking strategies and shortcuts</li>
            <li>Targeted skill drills can be more efficient for quick score improvements than general practice</li>
            <li>PrepU combines realistic practice questions with targeted drills to optimize your path to success</li>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">When should I take the SAT?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        <p>Several factors influence the ideal timing for your SAT:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>Recruited athletes and scholarship seekers may need to take it earlier</li>
            <li>Students applying to non-superscore schools should ensure they're fully prepared before testing</li>
            <li>Taking the SAT earlier has advantages:
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                    <li>Reduces test anxiety by allowing retakes if needed</li>
                    <li>Increases chances of a better superscore through multiple attempts</li>
                    <li>Frees up time for other college application tasks</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">The college search</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        <p>While college selection isn't our primary focus, here's how the SAT factors into the process:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>Even with test-optional policies, the SAT can be a valuable differentiator in competitive admissions</li>
            <li>SAT scores provide a standardized comparison between students from different schools</li>
            <li>Research each school's average SAT scores and 25th/75th percentile ranges</li>
            <li>Important note: Test-optional school statistics only reflect students who submitted scores, creating a self-selection bias</li>
            <li>Consider consulting with your college counselor or admissions officers about score submission strategies</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">When should I start preparing?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        <p>While there's no one-size-fits-all answer, we recommend:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>Starting early is generally advantageous</li>
            <li>Aim to begin preparation at least 12 weeks before your planned test date</li>
            <li>This timeline allows for comprehensive coverage of all test areas and practice</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Should I get a tutor?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        <p>The decision depends on various factors including your budget and learning style:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
