    <h2 class='sat-guide-section-header'>What is the covered in the "General Strategy" section?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        In the "General Strategy" section, we'll cover strategies that you can apply to the SAT as a whole, or to full sections of the SAT. This includes everything from how to prepare for the SAT, when to take the SAT, how to pace yourself, how to guess intelligently, how to spot wrong answers, how to approach test-day itself, and more. Later, in the Reading & Writing and Math sections, we'll get into more targeted strategies that are specific to those sections.

        Ultimately, learning the skills tested on the SAT is the most important part of doing well on the SAT. But students can still see significant improvements in their scores just by adjusting how they go about taking the test and employing our general strategies.
