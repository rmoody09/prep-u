    <div class="section-description">
        As of 2024, the SAT has moved away from the paper-based format and towards a digital format. This change was more than simply moving the test from paper to a screen. In addition to allowing the adaptive nature mentioned in the previous section, the digital format differs in a number of ways from the former paper-based format. These differences are summarized in the table below.

    <h2>Same 1st module for everyone, followed by a "hard" or "easy" 2nd Module</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        So how does this adaptive format work? It's actually quite simple. Everyone gets the exact same first module for both Reading & Writing and Math. For the second module in each section, they have prepared an "easy" module where the questions are on slightly easier than the first module, and a "hard" module where the questions are a bit more difficult. 
        Your performance on the first module will determine whether you receive the "easy" or "hard" second module. If you answer enough questions correctly on the first module, you will receive the harder second module. If you fail to do so, you will get the easier second module. 
        While the scoring algorithm is not transparent, students who get the harder second module will be able to miss more questions while still scoring higher than students who get the easier second module.
