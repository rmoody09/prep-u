    <div class="section-description">
        Each section of the SAT is scored on a 200-800 scale. So the maximum score a student can receive is 1600 (800 for Reading & Writing and 800 for Math). 
        The minimum total score is 400 (200 for Reading & Writing and 200 for Math). Even if a student answers every single question incorrectly, they will still receive 400 points.

    <h2>Curved Score</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        The SAT is scored on a curve, meaning that even if the test on one date happens to have slightly easier or harder questions than the test on another date, the same percentage of students will score around the same levels. So, if you happen to receive an "easier" test, you'll probably have to get more questions right to get the same score as someone who received a harder test.

    <h2>Is each question worth the same?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        On the old paper-based test, the answer was yes. Each question was worth the same amount of points. On the new SAT, the answer is more complicated. Their scoring algorithm isn't fully transparent, but it does seem that missing some questions can hurt you more than missing others. They employ "Item Response Theory" to weigh the difficulty of each question while arriving at your score. While it's more complicated than this, in general it will probably hurt you more to miss easy questions than harder ones.
