        Verb Form
    </h1>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How to Identify</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        When you look at the answer choices for a "verb form" question, you'll notice that the answer choices have the same verb taking different forms between choices. Some of the answer choices might be multi-word verb phrases (like "would have studied"), or might have some additional words beside the verb, but the main difference will be that the verb form is different between choices. 
        
        <div class="pt-4 pb-1 font-bold">
            Don't mistake a pronoun question for a verb form question
        </div>
        <div class="pb-1">Pronoun questions can sometimes look like they might be verb form questions. For example, if you have the 4 answer choices below, it would be a pronoun question, not a verb form question:</div>
        <ul class="pl-8">
            <li>
                it was
            </li>
            <li>
                they were
            </li>
            <li>
                some were
            </li>
            <li>
                one was
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="pt-2 pb-1">
            In the above example, even though the verb form is changing between some answer choices, the same exact verb form is repeated in multiple answer choices. However, each choice has a different pronoun, making this a pronoun question, not a verb form question.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Might Be Testing One Of Three Things</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Verb form questions might be testing one of the following three things:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Subject-verb agreement
            </li>
            <li>
                Verb tense
            </li>
            <li>
                Part of speech
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="pt-2 pb-1">
            The last of these is the least common, but it's actually the best one to start checking for first.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Part of speech...isn't a verb's part of speech a verb?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Well, yes and no. Words that are typically verbs can act as other parts of speech depending on how they are used and conjugated. In particular, when you place the word "to" in front of a verb, and when you have a verb ending in "-ing" without a helper verb before it, the verb acts as a different part of speech.
        
        <div class="font-bold text-lg pt-4 pb-2">
            What to look for
        </div>
        <div>
            To check if a verb for question might be testing you on which answer choice serves as the proper part of speech, look for one or both of the following in the answer choices:
            <ul class="pl-8 pt-2">
                <li>
                    The word "to" in front of a verb
                </li>
                <li>
                    A verb ending in "-ing" that doesn't come right after another verb
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="pt-3 pb-1">
                If you see one or both of the above, then not all the answer choices actually act as verbs, so we should consider if the blank might be playing a different role, as we'll explore below.
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="font-bold text-lg pt-6 pb-2">
            Verbs ending in "ing"
        </div>
        <div class="pl-4">  
            <div class='font-semibold pb-1'>Need a helper verb to act as a main verb</div>     
            <div>
                When we add "ing" to the end of a verb, it can only act as a main verb if it's preceded by helper verb, often a "to be" verb (e.g. "Tim is helping Mary with her move"). Without a helper verb, an "ing" verb cannot be the main verb in a sentence. It might be a gerund, a present participle, or it might be used to lead off a non-essential clause, as we'll explore below. Here are a few examples of "ing" verbs combined with a helper verb to act as a main verb phrase:
                <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                    <li>
                        "The cat <b>is sleeping</b>."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "The comfort of having close friends next to her <b>made watching</b> the scary movie more tolerable."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "The lion <b>started running</b> after its prey."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class='font-semibold pt-6 pb-1'>Can act as a noun (called a gerund)</div>
            <div>
                When an "ing" verb acts as a noun, it's called a gerund. For example, in the sentence "Sleeping is the cat's favorite activity", "sleeping" is used as noun that represents the activity of sleeping. This sentence is complete because  "sleeping" is the subject of the sentence and the main verb is "is". Here are a few more examples of gerunds:
                <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                    <li>
                        "Reading is a great way to learn."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Running helps Jack to stay fit."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Joes likes climbing mountains."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class='font-semibold pt-6 pb-1'>Can act as an adjective (called a present participle)</div>
            <div>
                "ing" verbs can also be used as an adjective, known as a present participle. For example, the phrase "The sleeping cat" is not a complete sentence because "sleeping" is not used as a verb; it is used as an adjective  to describe the state of the cat. We could make the sentence complete by adding a main verb, like "The sleeping cat was woken by the squeaking mouse." Here are a few more examples of present participles:
                <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                    <li>
                        "It's tough to commute to work without a working car"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "The dog chased the fleeing squirrel."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Anthony was annoyed by the barking dog."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="font-semibold pt-5 pb-1">"-ing" verbs can begin non-essential or essential clauses</div>
            <div>
                "-ing" verbs can also be used to lead off essential or non-essential clauses. In these cases, the "ing" verb is acting as an adjective to either give more information about a noun in the sentence (for non-essential clauses), or specify the noun or pronoun that referred to (for essential clauses). 
                <div class='pt-2'>
                    Here are some examples of "ing" verbs used to lead off non-essential clauses. These require commas or em dashes to separate the non-essential clauses.
                </div>
                <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                    <li>
                        "The cat —<b>hoping to finally catch its prey</b>— pounced on the red dot."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "<b>Hoping to finally catch its prey</b>, the cat pounced on the red dot."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "The cat pounced on the red dot, <b>hoping to finally catch its prey</b>."
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="pt-2">
                    And here are some examples of "ing" verbs used to lead off essential clauses:
                </div>
                <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                    <li>
                        "The student studying hardest will probably perform best on the test."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Most of the dogs were adorable, but the one barking his head off was annoying."

            "To" Verbs (aka Infinitives)
        </div>
        <div>
            When you add the word "to" in front of a verb, it becomes what's known as an infinitive verb, which does not act as a main verb. Depending on the context, it may act as a noun, adjective, or adverb. For example, in the sentence "To err is human", "to err" is an infinitive verb that acts as a noun, representing the act of erring. Also, in the sentence "I need to win", "to win" acts as a noun because it represents a thing that is needed. In the sentence "I went to buy bananas", "to buy" acts as an adverb because it describes the reason the subject "went". An infinitive verb can also act as an adjective, describing a noun. For example, in the sentence "The book to read is on the shelf", "to read" acts as an adjective describing the book.

            "-ed" Verbs Can Sometimes Act as Adjectives
        </div>
        <div>
            When a verb ends in "-ed", it can sometimes act as an adjective. It might be a straightforward adjective placed right before the noun it describes, or it might begin a non-essential or essential clause. Here are some examples:
            <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                <li>
                    "The deflated balloon no longer floats."
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            "deflated" is an adjective describing the state of the balloon
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The bride, dressed in a beautiful white dress, walked down the aisle."
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            "dressed" leads off a non-essential clause adding more information about the bride
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    "I'm not letting the dog covered in mud in the house."
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            "covered" leads off the essential clause "covered in mud", which specifies which dog is being referred to
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            Determine which choice plays the proper role
        </div>
        <div>
            On these types of questions, generally you will be able to intuitively tell which answer choice sounds right in the sentence. But hopefully the examples above will help you understand how to check for the different roles that a verb can play in its different forms. One thing to check for is if the sentence already has a main verb. If not, then the answer choice should have the verb in a form that can act as a main verb. Even if it does have a main verb already, sometimes a subject can perform multiple actions in a sentence (e.g. "The boxer bobbed and weaved to avoid his opponent's punches"), so don't jump right to assuming the blank can't act as a main verb.

    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Subject-verb agreement</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        If you don't see answer choices with infinitives or "ing" verbs without a helper verb, then the next thing to check for is subject-verb agreement. Subject-verb agreement is the concept that the subject of a sentence and the verb must agree in number. If the subject is singular, then the verb should also be in singular form. If the subject is plural, then the verb should be in plural form. For example, it would be improper to say "The cats sleeps." While the error in this example seems obvious, on the SAT you'll encounter much more complex sentences where the subject and verb aren't right next to each other, so the "ear test" (going with the option that sounds right) doesn't always make the right answer obvious.

        <div class="font-bold text-lg pt-8 pb-2">
            Start with the "it" test
        </div>
        <div>
            If the question is testing you on subject-verb agreement, then either 3 answer choices will use plural forms of the verb and one will be singular, or 3 answer choices will use singular forms of the verb and one will be plural. An easy way to check if this is the case is to plug in a singular pronoun before the verb in each answer choice (I generally like to use "it") and see it sounds right. If plugging in "it" sounds right, then the verb is singular. If plugging in "it" sounds wrong, then the verb is plural. So, if you perform the "it" test and find that there is a single outlier (either there is only one singular verb or there are exactly 3 singular verbs), then there's a good chance that the question is testing you on subject-verb agreement, and that the outlier is the right answer. Still, I would double check by identifying the subject and making sure it does indeed match the verb. If you don't find a single outlier, then the question must be testing for verb tense rather than subject-verb agreement, so you can move on to checking for verb tense.
        </div>

        <div class="font-bold text-lg pt-8 pb-2">
            Check the subject
        </div>
        <div>
            If the "it" test gave you a single outlier, if you're pressed for time then you might want to just select the outlier and move one, but it's generally good practice to double check by identifying the subject and making sure it matches the verb. Look at all the nouns earlier in the passage, and ask yourself if that is the specific noun that would be performing the verb in the answer choice.
