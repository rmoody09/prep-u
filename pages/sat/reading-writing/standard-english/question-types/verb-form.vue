        Verb Form

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How to Identify</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        When you look at the answer choices for a "verb form" question, you'll notice that the answer choices have the same verb taking different forms between choices. Some of the answer choices might be multi-word verb phrases (like "would have studied"), or might have some additional words beside the verb, but the main difference will be that the verb form is different between choices. 
        
        <div class="pt-4 pb-1 font-bold">
            Don't mistake a pronoun question for a verb form question
        </div>
        <div class="pb-1">Pronoun questions can sometimes look like they might be verb form questions. For example, if you have the 4 answer choices below, it would be a pronoun question, not a verb form question:</div>
        <ul class="pl-8">
            <li>
                it was
            </li>
            <li>
                they were
            </li>
            <li>
                some were
            </li>
            <li>
                one was
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="pt-2 pb-1">
            In the above example, even though the verb form is changing between some answer choices, the same exact verb form is repeated in multiple answer choices. However, each choice has a different pronoun, making this a pronoun question, not a verb form question.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Might Be Testing One Of Three Things</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Verb form questions might be testing one of the following three things:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Subject-verb agreement
            </li>
            <li>
                Verb tense
            </li>
            <li>
                Part of speech
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="pt-2 pb-1">
            The last of these is the least common, but it's actually the best one to start checking for first.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Part of speech...isn't a verb's part of speech a verb?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Well, yes and no. Words that are typically verbs can act as other parts of speech depending on how they are used and conjugated. In particular, when you place the word "to" in front of a verb, and when you have a verb ending in "-ing" without a helper verb before it, the verb acts as a different part of speech.
        
        <div class="font-bold text-lg pt-4 pb-2">
            What to look for
        </div>
        <div>
            To check if a verb for question might be testing you on which answer choice serves as the proper part of speech, look for one or both of the following in the answer choices:
            <ul class="pl-8 pt-2">
                <li>
                    The word "to" in front of a verb
                </li>
                <li>
                    A verb ending in "-ing" that doesn't come right after another verb
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="pt-3 pb-1">
                If you see one or both of the above, then not all the answer choices actually act as verbs, so we should consider if the blank might be playing a different role, as we'll explore below.

        <div class="pl-4">  
            <div class='font-semibold pb-1'>Need a helper verb to act as a main verb</div>     
            <div>
                When we add "ing" to the end of a verb, it can only act as a main verb if it's preceded by helper verb, often a "to be" verb (e.g. "Tim is helping Mary with her move"). Without a helper verb, an "ing" verb cannot be the main verb in a sentence. It might be a gerund, a present participle, or it might be used to lead off a non-essential clause, as we'll explore below. Here are a few examples of "ing" verbs combined with a helper verb to act as a main verb phrase:
                <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                    <li>
                        "The cat <b>is sleeping</b>."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "The comfort of having close friends next to her <b>made watching</b> the scary movie more tolerable."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "The lion <b>started running</b> after its prey."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class='font-semibold pt-6 pb-1'>Gerunds (when an "ing" verb acts as a noun)</div>
            <div>
                When an "ing" verb acts as a noun, it's called a gerund. For example, in the sentence "Sleeping is the cat's favorite activity", "sleeping" is used as noun that represents the activity of sleeping. This sentence is complete because  "sleeping" is the subject of the sentence and the main verb is "is". Here are a few more examples of gerunds:
                <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                    <li>
                        "Reading is a great way to learn."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Running helps Jack to stay fit."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Joes likes climbing mountains."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class='font-semibold pt-6 pb-1'>Present Participles (when an "ing" verb acts as an adjective)</div>
            <div>
                "ing" verbs can also be used as an adjective, known as a present participle. For example, the phrase "The sleeping cat" is not a complete sentence because "sleeping" is not used as a verb; it is used as an adjective  to describe the state of the cat. We could make the sentence complete by adding a main verb, like "The sleeping cat was woken by the squeaking mouse." Here are a few more examples of present participles:
                <ul class='pt-2 pl-8'>
                    <li>
                        "It's tough to commute to work without a working car"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "The dog chased the fleeing squirrel."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Anthony was annoyed by the barking dog."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="font-semibold pt-5 pb-1">"ing" verbs can begin non-essential clauses</div>
            <div>
                "Ing" verbs can also be used to lead off non-essential clauses, as we saw in the earlier section. For example, "The cat, <b>hoping to finally catch its prey</b>, pounced on the red dot." In that sentence, "hoping to finally catch its prey" is a non-essential clause that is separated from the rest of the sentence by commas, so "hoping" is not a main verb. These non-essential clauses might appear in the middle of a sentence, like we just saw, or they can also be at the beginning of a sentence ("Hoping to finally catch its prey, the cat pounced on the red dot."), or at the end of a sentence ("The cat pounced on the red dot, hoping to finally catch its prey.").

        <div class="font-bold text-lg pt-8 pb-2">
            "To" Verbs (aka Infinitives)
        </div>
        <div>
            When you add the word "to" in front of a verb, it becomes what's known as an infinitive verb, which does not act as a main verb. Depending on the context, it may act as a noun, adjective, or adverb. For example, in the sentence "To err is human", "to err" is an infinitive verb that acts as a noun, representing the act of erring. Also, in the sentence "I need to win", "to win" acts as a noun because it represents a thing that is needed. In the sentence "I went to buy bananas", "to buy" acts as an adverb because it describes the reason the subject "went". An infinitive verb can also act as an adjective, describing a noun. For example, in the sentence "The book to read is on the shelf", "to read" acts as an adjective describing the book.
