    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How They Are Used</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        There are two main ways that a semicolon might be used on the SAT:
        <ol>
            <li>
                To separate two complete sentences
            </li>
            <li>
                To separate items in a list.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div>
            We'll explain each in more detail below.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Separating Two Complete Sentences</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        The more common use of a semicolon is to separate two complete sentences that are closely related. For example, "I love studying; it helps me grow." It would be fine to use a period instead of a semicolon here, but the semicolon is perhaps more appropriate because it suggests that the two sentences are closely related, which they are. The SAT will never test you on this level of nuance though, so you will never have to decide if a semicolon or a period is a better fit. For the purposes of the SAT, they are interchangeable, unless a semicolon is being used for its other main purpose of separating items in a list.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Separating Items in a List</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        The other way a semicolon is used is to separate items in a list. As you probably know, the more common way to separate items in a list is with commas. So why would you use a semicolon instead? Typically, you would use a semicolon to separate items in a list when the items themselves contain commas. For example, "I traveled to Chicago, IL; Boston, MA; and New York, NY." Because each of these cities has a comma in its name, it would be more confusing to use commas to separate them - we'd have to decipher which commas represent separation of the cities from each other, and which commas represent the comma in the name of the city. A semicolon makes it clear that the cities are separate items in a list, and the commas in the names are just part of the name of the city.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">What To Do When You See a Semicolon in an Answer Choice</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        While separating list items is the less common use of semicolons, it's where I suggest you start because it's easier to check for. If the semicolon is being used to separate list items, then there will be at least one other semicolon in the sentence. So you should start off by looking to see if there is another semicolon in the sentence. If there is, we're probably looking at a list. Read the sentence under that context and see if it makes sense as a list. If it does, and that is the only answer choice with a semicolon, then you've found your answer. If there is another answer choice that also has a semicolon, then you'll have to figure out which one is appropriately placed to properly separate the items in the list. Here you'll want to keep in mind that list items should parallel each other in terms of structure. So pick the one that separates the items in a way in which the items each are similar in the way they are structured.

        <div class="pt-4">
            If the semicolon is not being used to separate list items, then for the answer to be correct, it must be separating two complete sentences. Remember, when it's being used in this way, the semicolon is interchangeable with a period, or with a comma followed by a FANBOYS conjunction. So if we see another answer choice that is identical but using a period instead of a semicolon, or a comma followed by a FANBOYS conjunction, then those answer choices would achieve the exact same effect as the semicolon. They can't both be correct, so we can infer that they must both be wrong and eliminate them. If we can't eliminate it for that reason, then it's time to check if it's separating two complete sentences. First, read the sentence leading up to the semicolon, and determine if it's a complete sentence. If not, the answer is wrong and we can eliminate it. If another answer choice happens to be the same but with a colon instead of a semicolon, we can eliminate that too, because a colon also requires a complete sentence before it. If we do have a complete sentence before the semicolon, then we need to check if the sentence after the semicolon is also a complete sentence. If it is, then we've found our answer. If it's not, then we can eliminate it.
