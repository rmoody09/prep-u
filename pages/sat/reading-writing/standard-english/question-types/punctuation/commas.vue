        Commas

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Commas Are Used in Many Ways</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Whereas most of the punctuation we've looked at is used in just one or two ways, commas can show up for a greater variety of purposes, making it a bit tougher to test whether a comma is appropriate. But we do have a few rules about when you definitely should NOT use a comma, so it's better to start there, to see if you can eliminate any answer choices with commas for one of these reasons.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Never Use a Comma Between a Title/Label and a Proper Noun</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Whenever you see a proper noun (like the name of a person) with a label or title before it, you should never use a comma between the label and the proper noun. For example, we might say "The theory of evolution was first proposed by scientist Charles Darwin" or "The Harry Potter series was written by author J.K. Rowling". In these cases, the labels or titles are "scientist" and "author", so we don't place a comma after them. It would be incorrect to say "The theory of evolution was first proposed by scientist, Charles Darwin". We could even be more loose with what we consider a label/title, for example, we could say "The series was devoured by book enthusiast Dave" - here the label is "book enthusiast", so we don't want a comma between "book enthusiast" and "Dave". This also applies to more official titles like "President" or "Doctor", although it tends to be more obvious that you don't want a comma there. On the SAT, if you see a comma coming between a label or title and a proper noun, you can eliminate it.
        <div class="pt-4">
            *An exception to this is when the label is preceded by the word "a" or "an". For example, "It was a scientist, Charles Darwin, who proposed the theory of evolution" is ok. But I wouldn't worry about this exception because I've never seen it come up on the SAT.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Never Separate a Subject and its Verb with a Single Comma</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Whenever you have a noun and a verb that is performed by that noun, they should not be separated by a comma. For example, "I went to the store" is correct, but "I went, to the store" is incorrect. This might seem obvious in this simplified example, but the SAT will have more complex sentences where it might not be so obvious. Note that we said a "single comma"; this is because you might have a parenthetical element coming between a noun and it's verb, and that is ok. For example, "John, who needed several things, went to the store" is correct. So when you see a comma in an answer choice, check whether it comes between a noun and the verb that is performed by that noun, without being part of a parenthetical element. If it does, you can eliminate it.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Don't Put a Comma Before Specifying Information</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        When a clause is necessary in order to specify which noun or nouns we are talking about, then it is considered "essential" to the sentence, and it should not be separated by a comma. For example, in the sentence "The t-shirts that are marked with red tags are 50% off", the dependent clause "that are marked with red tags" specifies which t-shirts are on sale and is essential to the meaning of the sentence. If we omit it ("The t-shirts are 50% off"), the sentence is still grammatically correct, but it doesn't convey the same meaning because it now sounds like all the t-shirts are on sale. The word "that" is typically used in essential clauses, so whenever you see a comma before the word "that" on an answer choice, it is almost always wrong. The word "which", on the other hand, typically indicates non-essential information, so it is ok to have a comma before it. For example, "The blue t-shirt, which I really like, is on sale." In this case we don't lose any essential information if we omit the "which I really like" clause. It's adding extra information, but it's not necessary to know what shirt we're talking about. Some pronouns, like "who", show up in both essential and non-essential clauses. For example, in the sentence "The man who is wearing the red shirt is my friend", the phrase "who is wearing the red shirt" is essential to the meaning of the sentence, so we don't to separate it with commas. But if we were to say "I'm friends with Steve, who is a nice guy", the phrase "who is a nice guy" is non-essential, so we can separate it with a comma. It's adding extra information about Steve, but it's not necessary to know who we're talking about.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Do Use a Comma to Separate Non-Essential Information</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        As was strongly suggested in the above section, when a clause is used to add extra information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence, then it is considered "non-essential" and it should be separated by a comma. These "extra information" clauses can show up at the beginning of a sentence, in the middle of a sentence, or at the end of a sentence. Some examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Hoping to find a good deal, Devin went to the store.</li>
            <li>Devin, who loves a good deal, went to the clearance sale.</li>
            <li>Devin went to the store, hoping to find a good deal.</li>
        </ul>

        While there are many other reasons for using commas, this tends to be the only reason that an answer choice on the SAT ends up being right because of a comma.
