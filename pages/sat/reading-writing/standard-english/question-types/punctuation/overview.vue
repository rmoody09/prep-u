        We'll dive into the applicable rules for each type of punctuation on their own pages, but here's a look at the types of punctuation that the SAT tests on punctuation questions:
        <ul>
            <li>Semicolons (;)</li>
            <li>Periods (.)</li>
            <li>Em Dashes (â€”)</li>
            <li>Colons (:)</li>
            <li>Commas (,)</li>
        </ul>
