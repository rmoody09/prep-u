        How to Identify Punctuation Questions
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Punctuation questions are ones where the main difference between the answer choices is how they are punctuated. Note that we said <span class="font-semibold">main difference</span> because there may also be a word or two different between the answer choices.

        We'll Address Apostrophe Questions Separately
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        While apostrophes are technically a type of punctuation, we will look at these as their own category of questions. This is because when the SAT tests on apostrophes, the answer choices won't differ in other types of punctuation, so these questions can be isolated.

        Important Concepts
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Before we jump into the types of punctuation tested, there are a couple of concepts we'll address first, because they are applicable to multiple types of punctuation. The first is identifying what constitutes a complete sentence, and how you can separate or combine complete sentences. The second is the concept of essential clauses vs non-essential clauses. We'll cover these concepts on their own pages next.

        Types of Punctuation Tested
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        We'll dive into the applicable rules for each type of punctuation on their own pages, but here's a look at the types of punctuation that the SAT tests on:
        <ul>
            <li>Semicolons (;)</li>
            <li>Periods (.)</li>
            <li>Em Dashes (â€”)</li>
            <li>Colons (:)</li>
            <li>Question Marks (?)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
