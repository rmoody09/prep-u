        Em Dashes
    </h1>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How They Are Used</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Emdashes are used to set off nonessential clauses â€” clauses that add extra information, but are not essential to the sentence. In fact, I just used one in that last sentence. Sneaky, huh? These nonessential clauses sometimes appear in the middle of a sentence, sometimes at the beginning, and sometimes at the end. In my experience, however, the SAT only uses em dashes to separate nonessential clauses in the middle of sentences or at the end of them. For nonessential clauses at the beginning of a sentence, the SAT prefers commas.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Nonessential Clause in the Middle of a Sentence</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        When the correct answer choice has an em dash, most of the time it's being used to separate a nonessential clause in the middle of the sentence. When em dashes separate nonessential clauses in the middle of a sentence, there are always two em dashes - one at the beginning of the nonessential clause and one at the end. Commas can also be used to separate nonessential clauses in the middle of a sentence, but you should never combine a comma and an em dash to separate a nonessential clause. Either the clause will be separated by a comma on either side, or it will be separated by an em dash on either side.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Nonessential Clause at the End of a Sentence</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        When an em dash is used to separate a nonessential clause at the end of a sentence, there is only one em dash, which will come at the beginning of the nonessential clause. If it's used properly, then you should have a complete sentence before the em dash, and what comes after the em dash is just providing extra information.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">When You See an Answer Choice with an Em Dash</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        When you see an answer choice with an em dash, you should first check if there is another em dash in the answer choice. If there is, then there's a good chance it's the right answer, and the two em dashes are separating a nonessential clause in the middle of a sentence. But you should try reading the sentence with that interpretation, and make sure it makes sense. If it's properly used, you should be able to remove everything between the em dashes and the sentence should still make sense; it will just lack the extra information provided by the nonessential clause. If this is the case, then you should select the answer choice.

        <div class="pt-4">
            If you don't see another em dash, then you should check if the em dash is separating a nonessential clause at the end of the sentence. If it is, then you should be able to end the sentence before the em dash and it should be a complete sentence that retains the meaning of the original sentence, just without the extra information provided by the nonessential clause. If this is the case, then you should select the answer choice.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">For More Information on Nonessential Clauses</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Nonessential clauses are a key concept when dealing with em dashes. We covered them in more detail in the <ULink active-class="text-primary" active to='/sat/reading-writing/standard-english/essential-nonessential' variant='outline' >Essential v& Nonessential Clauses</ULink> section. If you haven't read that section yet, or could use a refresher, now is a good time to check that page out.
