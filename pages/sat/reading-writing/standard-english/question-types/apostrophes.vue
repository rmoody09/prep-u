        When you look at the answer choices, the main difference will be where they place (or don't place) apostrophes. There may also be difference in the plurality of nouns and pronouns, and differences in using contractions (like "they're" vs. "their"). While apostrophes are a type of punctuation, we address these questions separately because when they show up on the SAT, you don't tend to see other types of punctuation changing between the choices.
