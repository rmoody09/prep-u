        Apostrophe Questions
    </h1>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">
        How to Identify
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        When you look at the answer choices, the main difference will be where they place (or don't place) apostrophes. There may also be difference in the plurality of nouns and pronouns, and differences in using contractions (like "they're" vs. "their"). Most of the time (but not all the time), there will be two words in the answer choices which are varying in their use of apostrophes. 
        <div class="pt-3">
            While apostrophes are a type of punctuation, we address these questions separately from "punctuation" questions because when they show up on the SAT, you don't tend to see other types of punctuation changing between the choices.

        What it's Testing
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        There are 3 things that these questions might be testing you on:
        <ul class="pt-1 pl-8">
            <li>Plurality of nouns and pronouns</li>
            <li>Use of contractions</li>
            <li>Possessiveness</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="pt-3">
            Note that it might be testing you on more than just one of these things, and that you often have to pay attention to the format of not just one but two words in the answer choices.

        Apostrophes Can Do Two Things
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        There are two main ways that apostrophes can be used: to indicate possession, or to indicate a contraction (combining two words into one).

        <div class="pt-3">
            <div class="font-bold">Possession</div>
            <div class="pt-1">
                When an apostrophe is used to indicate possession, you generally add an apostrophe followed by an "s" to the end of the word. For example, "the dog's bone" means that the bone belongs to the dog. When the word already ends in and "s" (either because it is plural, or the word just happens to end in "s"), then you just add an apostrophe after the existing "s". For example, if we are talking about a den that belongs to multiple lions, we would say "the lions' den".
            </div>
            <div class="pt-3">
                It's also important to note that possession doesn't necessarily have to refer to a physical possession. A trait or attribute can also be "possessed" by something. For example, "the house's color" is referring to a characteristic that belongs to the house, not a physical object that the house possesses.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="pt-6">
            <div class="font-bold">Contractions</div>
            <div class="pt-1">
                Apostrophes can also be used to combine two words into a contraction. For example, "they're" is a contraction of "they" and "are", "it's" is a contraction of "it" and "is", and "you're" is a contraction of "you" and "are", and so on. 
            </div>
            <div class="pt-3">
                One special, more universal contraction, is adding "'s" to the end of a noun to combine it with the word "is". For example, "Steve's going to the movies" is a contraction of "Steve is going to the movies".
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">
        Pronouns with apostrophes are always contractions
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Possessive pronouns have special forms that don't require an apostrophe (like "his", "her", "my", "your", "their", etc.), so if you see a pronoun with an apostrophe, you know it must be a contraction. Anytime you encounter a contraction, you should read it in your head as two separate words and see if it makes sense.

        Analyze Each Word that Differs
    </h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        As we noticed in the above example, there are often two words that differ between the answer choices. We need to analyze each of these words and narrow it down to the answer choices that use the correct form. We want to pay attention to the following when assessing each word:
        <ul class="pt-1 pl-8">
            <li>
                Plurality
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Should the word be plural?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Possessiveness
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Should the word be possessive?
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Contractions
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Any pronoun with an apostrophe is a contraction
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A noun ending with "'s" might be a contraction for that word plus "is" ("Jane's coming to the party") - but it might also be indicating possession ("Jane's book")
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Read any potential contraction as two separate words, and see if it makes sense in the sentence
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="pt-3">
            <div class="font-bold">Plural and Possessive</div>
            <div class="pt-1 pb-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
                If you have determined that the word should be plural and possessive, then assess it as outlined below:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If it's a pronoun
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Look for the plural possessive form of the pronoun (like "their")
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There should be no apostrophe in the word
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If it's a noun
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Generally, you add an "s" to the word, then add an apostrophe after the "s" (like "the kids' parents")
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some nouns have special plural forms that don't end in an "s" (like "mice"). In these cases, add an apostrophe then an "s" to the end of the word (like "the mice's home").
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li>
                            Look for the appropriate singular possessive form of the pronoun (like "his", "her", "my", "its", etc.)

                        <li>
