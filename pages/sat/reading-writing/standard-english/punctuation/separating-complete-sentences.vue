        Separating Complete Sentences

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">What's a Complete Sentence?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        A complete sentence, also known as an independent clause, is a sentence that expresses a complete thought. To qualify as a complete sentence, all a sentence needs is a subject and a verb. A subject is a noun or pronoun, and a verb is an action that the subject performs. For example, "The cat sleeps." is a complete sentence because it has a subject (cat) and a verb (sleeps). Complete sentences, particularly on the SAT, can be much more complex than this by incorporating additional modifiers, but the only criteria it needs to be a complete sentence is a subject and a verb performed by the subject.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">What Counts as a Verb?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Some words we would classically think of as verbs can become a different part of speech depending on how they are used. For example, when we add "ing" to the end of a verb, it can become a noun, known as a "gerund", or and adjective, known as a "present participle". For example, the phrase "The sleeping cat" is not a complete sentence because "sleeping" is not used as a verb; it is used as an adjective (known as a present participle) to describe the state of the cat. Or, in the sentence "Sleeping is the cat's favorite activity", "sleeping" is not used as a verb; it is used as noun (known as a gerund) that represents the activity of sleeping. This sentence is complete, however, because now "sleeping" is the subject of the sentence and the verb is "is". When you place a "to be" verb (like "is", "was", "are", etc.) in front of an "ing" verb, it becomes forms a verb phrase that can act as a main verb. For example "The cat is sleeping" is a complete sentence because "is sleeping" is a verb phrase that acts as the main verb.

            Infinitive Verbs
        </div>
        <div>
            When you add the word "to" in front of a verb, it becomes what's known as an infinitive verb, which does not act as an actionable verb. Depending on the context, it may act as a noun, adjective, or adverb. For example, in the sentence "To err is human", "to err" is an infinitive verb that acts as a noun, representing the act of erring. Also, in the sentence "I need to win", "to win" acts as a noun because it represents a thing that is needed. In the sentence "I went to buy bananas", "to buy" acts as an adverb because it describes the reason the subject "went". An infinitive verb can also act as an adjective, describing a noun. For example, in the sentence "The book to read is on the shelf", "to read" acts as an adjective describing the book.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Ways to Separate or Connect Complete Sentences</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        There are several ways that you can properly separate or connect two complete sentences, summarized below:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="font-semibold">
                    Periods
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The most common and obvious way to separate two complete sentences is to use a period. For example, "The cat sleeps. The dog barks."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="font-semibold">
                    Semicolons
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For the purposes of the SAT, semicolons can be used interchangeably with periods. Both can be used to separate complete sentences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In reality, there is more nuance to deciding whether we would use a semicolon or a period. A semicolon suggests there is a stronger connection between the two sentences. However, the SAT doesn't test you on that level of nuance, so we won't focus on it. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Semicolons also have a second use, which is to separate items in a list. We'll get into this more in the semicolons section.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="font-semibold">
                    Comma + FANBOYS conjunction
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We can also connect two independent clauses with a comma and a coordinating conjunction. We use the acronym FANBOYS to remember the coordinating conjunctions: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. For example, "The cat sleeps, and the dog barks." properly connects two independent clauses (aka complete sentences).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The comma should be placed before the conjunction. For example, "The cat sleeps and, the dog barks." would not work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A comma on its own is not enough to connect two independent clauses. For example, "The cat sleeps, the dog barks." is not a proper sentence. This would be considered a comma splice, which is a grammatical error. We need the coordinating conjunction after the comma to connect the two clauses.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="font-semibold">
                    Colons
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A colon can sometimes be used to connect two complete sentences, but it might also come between a complete sentence and a sentence fragment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whenever a colon is used correctly, there should always be a complete sentence before the colon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the colon, we may have a complete sentence, or we might have a sentence fragment.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Adjacent Complete Sentences ALWAYS Require One of the Above</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        It's not just that you CAN use one of the above to connect two complete sentences; when there are two complete sentences next to each other, you MUST use one of the above to connect them. Otherwise, there is some grammatical error sucha as a run-on sentence or a comma splice.
