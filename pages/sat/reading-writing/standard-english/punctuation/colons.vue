        Colons

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How They Are Used</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Colons are used to introduce a list, or to introduce a clause that is explains or exemplifies what comes before it. For example, "There are three reasons why I like to read: it's fun, it's educational, and it's a good way to relax." In this sentence, the colon introduces the list of reasons.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">A Complete Sentence Should Always Come Before a Colon</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        When a colon is used correctly, it should always come at the end of a complete sentence. For example, it would be incorrect to say "The three reasons why I like to read are: it's fun, it's educational, and it's a good way to relax." Since "The three reasons why I like to read are" is not a complete sentence, this is not a correct use of a colon.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">There May or May Not Be a Complete Sentence After the Colon</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        While we always need a complete sentence before the colon, what follows the colon is more flexible. It may be a complete sentence, or it may be a fragment. For example, we often have a list, which is not a complete sentence, coming after the colon: "I went to the store to buy three things: a shirt, a pair of pants, and a pair of shoes." Or we can have other types of dependent clauses after a colon, like in this example: "I went to the store for one reason: to buy a shirt." But, sometimes we will see a complete sentence after the colon, like in this example: "The meeting was a disaster: the speaker was late, the room was too small, and the projector didn't work." Here we have a complete sentence after the colon, and the colon is appropriate because what comes after explains why the meeting was a disaster.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">If You See a Colon in an Answer Choice</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        If you see a colon in an answer choice, the first thing you should check is whether you have a complete sentence ending at the colon. If you don't, you can eliminate it. If you do, then it's most likely the correct answer because the SAT doesn't generally test you on whether a colon expresses the right relationship between two ideas; they mostly just test you on whether it is grammatically incorrect due to an incomplete sentence before it. But it's still worth checking if you think a colon makes sense and expresses the right relationship between what comes before and after it.
