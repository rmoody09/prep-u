        Parenthetical Elements

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">What's a Parenthetical Element?</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Parenthetical elements are dependent clauses (they are not a complete sentence on their own) used in the middle of a sentence to add extra information to a sentence. They are nonessential, meaning that you could eliminate the whole parenthetical element from the sentence without changing the main meaning of the sentence. For example, "Kevin, who is studying hard for the SAT, is hoping for a good score." In this sentence, "who is studying hard for the SAT" is a parenthetical element. Note that it is not a complete sentence on its own, and also that we can read the sentence without it with the sentence remaining complete: "Kevin is hoping for a good score."

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How to Punctuate a Parenthetical Element</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        As you could perhaps guess from its name, you could place parentheses around a parenthetical element to set it off from the rest of the sentence. For example, "Kevin (who is studying hard for the SAT) is hoping for a good score." But the SAT really only tests you on the other two ways to punctuate a parenthetical element: commas and em dashes. In our original example, we placed commas on either side of the parenthetical element to set it off from the rest of the sentence. Instead, we could have used two em dashes: "Kevin — who is studying hard for the SAT — is hoping for a good score." It doesn't matter which punctuation you use, but it is important that you use the same punctuation on both sides of the parenthetical element; you can't use a comma on one side and an em dash on the other. For example, "Kevin, who is studying hard for the SAT — is hoping for a good score." would be incorrect.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">If You See an Em Dash in an Answer Choice</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        If you see an em dash in an answer choice, you should immediately check if it's being used as a parenthetical element. To do this, you should first check if there is another em dash in the sentence. If there is, then there is a good chance that the two em dashes are being used to set off a parenthetical element, making this the correct answer. But you'll still want to read the sentence in that context, and make sure that the text between the em dashes makes sense as a parenthetical element. Does it add extra information about whatever is mentioned before it? If you remove it from the sentence, does the sentence still make sense? If so, then this is the correct answer. If not, don't be too hasty to eliminate it, because there is one other reason for using an em dash, which we'll cover in the em dashes section.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">If You See a Comma in an Answer Choice</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Commas have many different uses, so I would start by assessing other answer choices (like ones with semicolons, em dashes, colons, etc.) before analyzing the options with commas. If you've eliminated all of the other answer choices, then I would start by checking if there is a good reason that a comma should NOT be there (more on this in the commas section). If we can't eliminate if for one of these reasons, then we can check to see if it's being used to set off a parenthetical element. To do this, we can look for another comma (either before or after it) in the sentence. If there is one, then assess it to see if the text between the two commas makes sense as a parenthetical element. If you see a comma both before it and after it in the sentence, then make sure you test pairing it with each of them to see if either is a parenthetical element. If it makes sense as a parenthetical element, then this is the correct answer. If it doesn't, then don't eliminate it just yet, because there are still some other reasons for using commas (we'll cover this more in the commas section).
