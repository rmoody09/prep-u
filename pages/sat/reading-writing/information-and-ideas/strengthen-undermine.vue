        These questions will show up after the details and main idea questions. The wording can vary somewhat, but it will ask which of the answer choices, if true, would either strengthen or undermine a claim made in the text. Look out for the words "if true", and words like strengthen, support, weaken, undermine, etc.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How to Approach</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Since the question is asking about a claim made in the text, you should start by identifying exactly what that claim is. However, just knowing the claim alone isn't often enough to evaluate the answer choices; you'll want to read the rest of the passage to gain some extra context around that claim. Ask yourself how the author arrived at that claim, and see if you can come up with some scenarios in your mind that would either support or undermine that claim (depending on the question). Once you have a good understanding of the claim and the context of the passage, you should proceed to evaluate the answer choices with process of elimination.
