    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How to Identify</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        These questions are pretty easy to identify, because they are the only ones in the Reading & Writing section that have some kind of graphic like a chart, graph, or table.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Example Question</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        <div class="question-container">
            <ClientOnly>
                <SATProblem problem_id="51cf8d0d-de45-47fd-9713-dc8961f1896a" />
            </ClientOnly>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Ignore the Graphic Initially</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Without any context, the graphic can often be difficult to interpret. And even if it's relatively straightforward, until you read the question and passage, you don't know what you're looking for. So don't bother trying to analyze the graphic until you've read the question and passage.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Read the Question Carefully</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        The actual question can vary between problems. It will often ask you to use data from the graphic to either support or weaken a claim or hypothesis made in the passage. Or, sometimes there will be a blank in the passage, and you need to choose the answer that best uses data from the graphic to fill in the blank. Pay careful attention to exactly what the question is asking you to do. Especially if it's asking you to use data that weakens the claim, as it is easy to just assume that we're looking for something to support the claim.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Identify the Hypothesis or Claim</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        There is almost always a claim or hypothesis being made in the passage. Typically, this will fall in the last sentence or two of the passage. Try to identify what this claim or hypothesis is before looking at the graphic or reading the rest of the passage.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Read the Full Passage</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Once you've identified the central claim or hypothesis, you'll likely need the context of the rest of the passage to better understand the claim and be prepared to answer the question. So now go to the beginning of the passage, and read it carefully, asking yourself how information from the passage relates to the claim or hypothesis.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Read the Title of the Graphic</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Now that you know what the question is asking, what the claim is, and have read the passage, it's time to look at the graphic. Students often overlook the title of the graphic, but it can deliver important information relevant to interpreting the graphic. So make sure you read the title of the graphic before jumping in and analyzing the data from it.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Read the Axis Labels and Any Keys</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Now to get a full sense of what the graphic is depicting, you'll need to read the axis labels and any keys that are provided.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Look For Trends that Answer the Question</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Now you should have a good sense of how to interpret the graphic, so see if you can spot anything in the graphic that answers the question. For example, if the question asks you to use data from the graphic to support the hypothesis, look for trends in the data that support the hypothesis. If you aren't able to quickly find what you're looking for, don't spend too much time on it - you can always go through the answers and they might help point you toward what to look for. If you do think you spot data that achieves what you're looking for, then you can skim the answers to see if there is one that points out the trend in the data you found.
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Use Process of Elimination</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        If you were able to spot the right trend yourself and find it in the answer choices, then you might not need to do this - if you feel confident you can just select it and move on. But often it's best to go through the answer choices one by one. When you do so, ask yourself two things:
        <div class="font-semibold">
            Does the answer choice achieve the goal of the question?
        </div>
        <div>
            Before worrying about whether the answer choice is actually reflected in the data, let's assume it is and ask whether it does a good job of achieving the goal of the question. If not, then you can eliminate it without having to check the data.
        </div>
        <div class="font-semibold">
            Is the answer choice supported by the data?
        </div>
        <div>
            If the answer choice seems like it would achieve the goal of the question, then we need to make sure it is also supported by the data. If it's not, then we can eliminate it. If it is, then we've found our answer!
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Common Wrong Answers</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        <div class="font-semibold">
            Achieves the Goal, but Not Supported by the Data
        </div>
        <div>
            Some wrong answers would be a good choice to answer the question if they were actually true, but they might not line up with the data provided. If the answer choices doesn't line up with the data in the graphic, then it's not the right answer.
        </div>
        <div class="font-semibold">
            Reflected in the data, but doesn't answer the question
        </div>
        <div>
            Other wrong answers might take actual data from the graphic, but that data either goes against what the question is looking to achieve, or is irrelevant to it.
