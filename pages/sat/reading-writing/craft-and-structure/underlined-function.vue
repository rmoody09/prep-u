        You will know that you are looking at one of these questions because you will see an underlined sentence in the passage, and the question will always read exactly: "Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?"

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">How to Approach</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        Note that this is not simply asking for the meaning of the underlined text. It's asking what function it plays in the passage as a whole. So you want to make sure you get a feel for the passage as a whole, and think about how the underlined text relates to the other sentences. Does it make a claim that is then supported by the next sentence? Is it an example of the sentence that comes before it? These are the kinds of things you should be looking for. Before looking at the answer choices, try to think of how the underlined text plays into the passage as a whole.

        Be on the lookout for all the common wrong answer types we discussed in <ULink class="text-primary" to='/sat/reading-writing/wrong-answers'>Wrong Answers</ULink>, but especially the following:
        <div class="pt-4">
            <div>
                <strong>Supported by the text, but doesn't relate to the underlined text</strong>
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>Conveys what's in the underlined text, but not the function that it plays in the passage</strong>
            </div>
