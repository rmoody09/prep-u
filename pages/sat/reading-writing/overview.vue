    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Format</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        The Reading & Writing section is broken into two 35-minute modules with 27 questions each. Every question will have its own short passage, usually no more than about 150 words, and will have 4 multiple choice options. Both modules are formatted similarly, but due to the adaptive nature of the test, one module will be more difficult than the other (depending on how you do on the first module).
    </div>

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Order of Questions</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        In the Reading & Writing modules questions are grouped together by question type, and the question types will always fall in the same order. It will always start off with a few "Words in Context" questions, and will always finish with some "Rhetorical Synthesis" questions, with many other types in between. We'll get into more detail on the exact question types and their order in the "Question Types" section.
