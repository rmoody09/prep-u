    <h2 class='sat-guide-section-header'>Way more than just a guide</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        SAT prep books are great and can be super helpful. However, they can't do what PrepU does. They are not interactive. They are not personalized. They are not adaptive. 
        <div class="pt-4">
            PrepU was designed and built by an experienced SAT tutor who is also an experienced software developer. By combining his two skillsets, he has created a tool that will help you learn and practice for the SAT in an optimized and interactive way that you won't get from any other book, or digital guide or tool.

    <h2 class='sat-guide-section-header'>How to use PrepU</h2>
    <div class="section-description">
        If you have plenty of time to prepare for the SAT, then we recommend going through our guide start to finish. This will provide you with the best foundation, and ensure that you have the context and skills to fully take advantage of each step of our guide.
        <div class="pt-4">
            However, if you are short on time, or some sections of the guide are already familiar to you, we've designed it in a way that is easy to skip around, so you can focus on the areas you need the most help with.
