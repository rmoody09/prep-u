    <div class="section-description">
        Questions that fall under "Advanced Math" on the SAT test your understanding of nonlinear relationships. In other words, they will involve functions, graphs, and algebraic expressions that cannot be depicted by a straight line. The main types of nonlinear relationships you'll see are quadratics and exponentials, but you may also see radical functions, circle functions, and more.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Quadratic Functions</h2>
    <div class="sat-guide-section-content">
        <div class="section-description">
            Quadratic functions are equations that can be expressed in the form <span v-html="'<math><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>a</mi><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></math>'"></span>, where a, b, and c are constants. For example, <span v-html="'<math><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></math>'"></span>. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, which is a U-shaped curve that opens either up or down. We'll get into more detail about different types of problems involving quadratics and how to solve them in the "Quadratic Functions" section.

    <h2 class="sat-guide-section-header">Exponential Functions</h2>
    <div class="sat-guide-section-content">
        <div class="section-description">
            Exponential functions are functions where the variable is in the exponent. For example, <span v-html="'<math><mi>y</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msup></math>'"></span>. The graph of an exponential function is a curve that increases (exponential growth) or decreases (exponential decay) rapidly. We'll get into more detail about different types of problems involving exponentials and how to solve them in the "Exponential Functions" section.
