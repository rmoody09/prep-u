        Exponential functions are functions that increase or decrease by a constant factor as the independent variable increases. This is different from linear functions, which increase or decrease by a constant amount as the independent variable increases. In other words, exponential functions are being multiplied or divided by the same constant factor for each unit increase in the independent variable, whereas linear functions are being added or subtracted by the same constant amount for each unit increase in the independent variable. You can recognize an exponential function by the fact that the independent variable is found in an exponent.

                The general form of an exponential function typically looks like this:

                Theoretically, there could be an additional constant added to the function, so the
