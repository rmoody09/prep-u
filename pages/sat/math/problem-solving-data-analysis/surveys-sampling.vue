                A survey is a method of collecting data from a subset of a larger population. The subset is called a sample, and the larger group it's drawn from is called the population. The goal of sampling is to make inferences about the entire population based on the data collected from the sample.

                        <strong>Population:</strong> The entire group of individuals, items, or data points that you want to study. For example, all registered voters in a country, all students in a school, or all products manufactured by a company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Sample:</strong> A subset of the population that is actually surveyed or measured. For example, 1,000 registered voters, 100 students, or 50 products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to understand that we rarely survey an entire population because:

                        <li>It's usually unnecessary - a well-designed sample can provide accurate results</li>
                        <li>It's more cost-effective to survey a smaller group</li>

                        There are several methods for selecting a sample from a population. The method used affects how well the sample represents the population.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Random Sampling:</strong> Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This is the ideal method for ensuring a representative sample.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Stratified Sampling:</strong> The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics, and then random samples are taken from each subgroup.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Systematic Sampling:</strong> Every nth member of the population is selected (e.g., every 10th person on a list).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Convenience Sampling:</strong> Members of the population are selected based on their availability or ease of access. This method often leads to biased results.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Volunteer Sampling:</strong> Members of the population self-select to participate. This method often leads to biased results.

                    <p>
                        On the SAT, you'll need to evaluate whether a sampling method is appropriate for making inferences about a population.

            Drawing Estimates from Samples
        </h2>
        <div class="sat-guide-section-content">
            <p>
                When we collect data from a sample, we use that data to make estimates about the entire population. These estimates are not exact values but rather approximations with a certain level of uncertainty.
            </p>

            <div class="sat-guide-subsection">
                <h3 class="sat-guide-subsection-header">Point Estimates</h3>
                <div class="sat-guide-subsection-content">
                    <p>
                        A point estimate is a single value used to estimate a population parameter. For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean</li>
                        <li>The sample proportion is a point estimate of the population proportion</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Example: If a survey of 1,000 registered voters finds that 45% support a particular candidate, then 45% is a point estimate of the percentage of all registered voters who support that candidate.
                    </p>

                <h3 class="sat-guide-subsection-header">Margin of Error</h3>
                <div class="sat-guide-subsection-content">
                    <p>
                        The margin of error is a measure of the uncertainty in a point estimate. It represents the range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the SAT, you'll often see survey results presented with a margin of error, such as "45% ± 3%." This means that the true percentage in the population is likely to be between 42% and 48%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The margin of error depends on several factors:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sample Size:</strong> Larger samples generally have smaller margins of error</li>
                        <li><strong>Population Size:</strong> For very large populations, the margin of error depends mainly on the sample size</li>
                        <li><strong>Confidence Level:</strong> Higher confidence levels result in larger margins of error</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        While you won't need to calculate the margin of error on the SAT, you should understand how to interpret it and how it affects the conclusions you can draw from survey results.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="sat-guide-subsection-content">
                    <p>
                        A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter. It is calculated by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the point estimate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: If a survey finds that 45% of respondents support a candidate with a margin of error of 3%, the 95% confidence interval is 42% to 48%. This means we can be 95% confident that the true percentage of all voters who support the candidate is between 42% and 48%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the SAT, you'll need to understand how to interpret confidence intervals and use them to make inferences about populations.

                        When a survey asks yes/no questions or questions with categorical responses, the results are often reported as proportions or percentages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: A survey of 500 students finds that 60% prefer online learning to traditional classroom learning. We can estimate that approximately 60% of all students prefer online learning, with some margin of error.

                        Example: A survey of 100 households finds that the average monthly electricity bill is $120. We can estimate that the average monthly electricity bill for all households is approximately $120, with some margin of error.

                        Surveys often compare different groups within a population. On the SAT, you'll need to understand how to interpret these comparisons and determine if differences between groups are statistically significant.

                        The sampling frame is the list of individuals or items from which the sample is drawn. It defines the population that the survey results can be generalized to.

                        When survey results include margins of error, you need to consider the range of possible values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: A survey finds that 45% of respondents support a candidate with a margin of error of 3%. This means the true percentage is likely to be between 42% and 48%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If another survey finds that 48% of respondents support the same candidate with a margin of error of 3%, we cannot conclude that support has increased, because the confidence intervals overlap (42% to 48% and 45% to 51%).

                <div class="sat-guide-subsection-content">
                    <p>
                        To determine if a sample is representative of a population, compare the characteristics of the sample to the characteristics of the population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: A survey of 100 students at a university finds that 60% are female. If 55% of all students at the university are female, the sample is reasonably representative in terms of gender.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, if the survey was conducted only in the nursing department, where 80% of students are female, the sample would not be representative of the entire university.

                <h3 class="sat-guide-subsection-header">Making Predictions Based on Survey Data</h3>
                <div class="sat-guide-subsection-content">
                    <p>
                        Survey data can be used to make predictions about future events or behaviors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: A survey finds that 70% of customers are satisfied with a product. If there are 1,000 customers, we can predict that approximately 700 customers will continue to use the product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, these predictions are not guaranteed. They are based on the assumption that the sample is representative of the population and that the behavior of the population will remain consistent over time.
