                        <strong>Vertical Angles:</strong> When two lines intersect, the angles opposite each other are called vertical angles. Vertical angles are always equal in measure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Complementary Angles:</strong> Two angles are complementary if the sum of their measures is 90 degrees. For example, if one angle measures 30 degrees, its complement measures 60 degrees.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Supplementary Angles:</strong> Two angles are supplementary if the sum of their measures is 180 degrees. For example, if one angle measures 120 degrees, its supplement measures 60 degrees.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Linear Pair:</strong> A linear pair consists of two adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line. The angles in a linear pair are always supplementary.

                        An angle bisector is a line or ray that divides an angle into two equal parts. If a line bisects an angle, it creates two angles of equal measure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: If a line bisects an angle of 80 degrees, it creates two angles of 40 degrees each.

                        A line bisector is a line that divides another line segment into two equal parts. The point where the bisector intersects the line segment is called the midpoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: If a line bisects a line segment of length 10 units, it creates two segments of 5 units each.

                    <p>
                        When a transversal (a line that intersects two or more other lines) crosses parallel lines, several special angle relationships are formed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Corresponding angles are equal in measure.</li>

                        <li>Same-side interior angles are supplementary (their sum is 180 degrees).</li>
                        <li>Same-side exterior angles are supplementary (their sum is 180 degrees).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        While you don't need to memorize the terminology, understanding these relationships is crucial for solving problems involving parallel lines and transversals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, and one of the angles formed measures 70 degrees, you can determine the measures of the other angles using these relationships.

                Geometry problems on the SAT can often be solved more easily by applying certain strategies and techniques. Here are some general tips to help you approach these problems effectively.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Create or Redraw Diagrams:</strong> Whenever possible, create or redraw diagrams on your scratch paper. This helps you visualize the problem and identify relationships between different elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Extend Lines:</strong> It often helps to draw imaginary lines extending from polygons. This can reveal hidden relationships and make it easier to apply geometric principles.
